Hi, I join Huawei Cloud Database Innovation Lab through TopMinds program as a research scientist. Before that I graduate from the Database Group in [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/), where I am supervised by [Prof. Jeffrey Xu Yu](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/people/academic-staff/prof-yu-xu-jeffrey/) in 2022. I obtained my B.E. degree from HongYi Honor Class of Wuhan University in 2017.

I have a broad interest in query optimization/execution for large scale OLAP query in distributed environment. More specifically, I'm intereseted in (1) **unified execution/optimization of cross-domain queries (e.g., SQL + Graph + AI)**, (2) **machine learning based query optimization, which is also known as AI4DB**,(3) **query execution/optimization of complex OLAP query**, e.g., subgraph (counting) query.

I develop several distributed SQL/Graph systems based on Spark/Hadoop. 

In huawei, I'm working on building the next generation unified data processing engine. 

**I am hiring for full-time and interns who are interested in the system research and building, please drop me a link if interested~**

### Systems

* **SeccoSQL** (ongoing): SeccoSQL (Separate communication from computation) is an experimental distributed SQL engine on Spark for processing complex SQL/Graph queries. It explicitly decouples RA operators into pure communication and computation operators, and can reorder operators at a finer granularity than existing SQL engine (i.e., reordering communications and computations versus reorder- ing RA operators), which enables greater search space of plan and can further reduce communication cost.

* **[DISC](https://github.com/H20Zhang/DISC)**: DISC is a specialized graph system on Spark for computing subgraph counting of arbitrary patterns and orbits in a relational way. Unlike existing subgraph counting approaches, which perform subgraph counting directly on graph, it decomposes the subgraph counting query into a sequence of relational queries, which can be efficiently executed.

* **[Crystal](https://github.com/H20Zhang/Crystal)**: Crystal is a novel method for distributed subgraph matching on very large graphs. It differs from existing subgraph matching approaches in that it can compute an compressed results of subgraph matching directly, which also greatly reduce the computation cost.
