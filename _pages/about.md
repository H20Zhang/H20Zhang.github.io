I am a research scientist at Huawei Cloud Database Innovation Lab, recruited through the TopMinds program. I obtained my graduate degree from the Database Group at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/) in 2022 under the guidance of [Prof. Jeffrey Xu Yu](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/people/academic-staff/prof-yu-xu-jeffrey/), following my B.E. degree from the HongYi Honor Class of Wuhan University in 2017.

My research interests lie in query optimization and execution for large-scale OLAP queries, with a focus on two main areas:

1. Exploiting AI for Data Systems:
   - Leveraging Tensor Computation Runtime (TCR) as a backend to support various data analytic tasks, including relational algebra queries, subgraph graph queries, graph analytic queries, and ANNs.
   - Implementing machine learning-based query optimization (AI4DB) to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of query processing.
   - Pursuing unified execution and optimization of cross-domain queries, integrating SQL, graph, and AI technologies.

2. Building High-Performance Composable Graph Databases:
   - Developing high-performance graph-native storage and caching mechanisms.
   - Creating high-performance primitives to support graph database operations.
   - Optimizing complex graph queries, such as subgraph counting queries, to tackle challenges posed by intricate data structures and analytical requirements.

Currently, I am leading the development of the next-generation unified data processing engine at Huawei.

### Systems

* **TCRDS (2022-)**: TCRDS is a unified analytic engine for SQL queries, Subgraph queries, and Graph Analytic Queries, built upon Tensor Computation Runtime (TCR), such as PyTorch. Leveraging a highly optimized and cross-platform TCR backend, TCRDS achieves full-speed operation on all platforms (including Nvidia GPU, AMD GPU, Apple M series SoC, and Huawei Ascend), outperforming traditional purpose-built systems by orders of magnitude.

* **[SeccoSQL](https://github.com/H20Zhang/SeccoSQL) (2020-2022)**: SeccoSQL (Separate communication from computation) is an experimental distributed SQL engine on Spark designed for processing complex SQL/Graph queries. It explicitly decouples Relational Algebra (RA) operators into pure communication and computation operators. SeccoSQL can reorder operators at a finer granularity than existing SQL engines, enabling a greater search space of plans and further reducing communication costs.

* **[DISC](https://github.com/H20Zhang/DISC) (2018-2020)**: DISC is a specialized graph system on Spark for computing subgraph counts of arbitrary patterns and orbits in a relational manner. Unlike existing subgraph counting approaches that operate directly on graphs, DISC decomposes subgraph counting queries into a sequence of relational queries, enabling efficient execution.

* **[Crystal](https://github.com/H20Zhang/Crystal) (2016-2017)**: Crystal is a novel method for distributed subgraph matching on very large graphs. It differs from existing subgraph matching approaches by computing compressed results of subgraph matching directly, greatly reducing computation costs.
