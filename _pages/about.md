Hi, I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the Database Group in [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/), where I am supervised by [Prof. Jeffrey Xu Yu](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/people/academic-staff/prof-yu-xu-jeffrey/). Before that, I obtained my B.E. degree from HongYi Honor College of Wuhan University in 2017.



I have a broad interest in **distributed relational engine **, **online analytical processing(OLAP)** ,and **distributed computing**, especially combining new advancement in the theory of database with state-of-the-art systems. Currently, my research interests focuses on distributed relational engine for complex OLAP.
