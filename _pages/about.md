Hi, I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. student at the Database Group in [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/), where I am supervised by [Prof. Jeffrey Xu Yu](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/people/academic-staff/prof-yu-xu-jeffrey/). Before that, I obtained my B.E. degree from HongYi Honor Class of Wuhan University in 2017.

I have a broad interest in query optimization/execution for large scale OLAP query in distributed environment. More specifically, I'm intereseted in 1) **optimizing complex OLAP query**, e.g., subgraph (counting) query, in distributed environment,  2) **utilizing machine learning techniques for query optimization**, 3) **unifying query execution/optimization of complex OLAP query**, e.g., SQL query, subgraph query, graph analytic query , graph learning query, into a single system. 

**I am looking for position in industry. Please drop me an email if interested~**
