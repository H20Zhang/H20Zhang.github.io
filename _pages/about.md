Hi, I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. student at the Database Group in [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/), where I am supervised by [Prof. Jeffrey Xu Yu](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/people/academic-staff/prof-yu-xu-jeffrey/). Before that, I obtained my B.E. degree from HongYi Honor Class of Wuhan University in 2017.

I have a broad interest in query optimization/execution for large scale OLAP query in distributed environment. More specifically, I'm intereseted in 1) optimizing complex OLAP query, i.e., subgraph (counting) query, in distributed environment,  2) utilizing machine learning techniques for query optimization, 3) unifying query execution/optimization of complex OLAP query, i.e., subgraph query, graph analytic query , graph learning query, into a single system.
