I am a Research Scientist at Huawei Cloud Database Innovation Lab, recruited through the prestigious TopMinds program. I earned my Ph.D. from the Database Group at The Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2022, under the mentorship of Prof. Jeffrey Xu Yu. Prior to that, I obtained my B.E. degree from the HongYi Honor Class at Wuhan University in 2017.

### Research Interests

My current research focuses on preparing the data system for the AI Era, particularly in the following areas:

1. Data System: Design and Optimization of Next-Generation AI accelerated Data Systems for Compound AI Workload
	-	Building SQL, Cypher (Graph queries), Graph Analytics engine on top of Tensor Computation Runtimes (TCR), e.g. Pytorch, to support diverse compound AI workload. 
	-	Optimizing cross-domain ML pipelines, encompassing SQL, Graph, and ML queries.
	-	Enhancing query optimization through machine learning-based approaches (AI4DB) to improve processing efficiency and effectiveness.
2. Knowledge System: Development of High-Performance Graph Databases (Knowledge Graph) / ANN system for LLM:
	-	Building highly optimized ANN engine on top of Tensor Computation Runtime (TCR), which lays in the same system as LLM. 
	-	Building world record breaking level graph database to accelerate the serving of graph to LLM. 
	-	Optimizing mixed ANN query that encompassing ANN query and relational query.

My previous research interest includes:
- Distributed query processing system that focous on solving complex relational/graph queries.
- Algorithms for foundamental problems in graph, i.e., subgraph matching.


Currently, I am leading the development/research of next-generation AI accelerated data systems and the research of knowledge system at Huawei.

### Systems

* **TCRDS (2022-)**: TCRDS is a unified analytic engine for SQL queries, Subgraph queries, and Graph Analytic Queries, built upon Tensor Computation Runtime (TCR), such as PyTorch. Leveraging a highly optimized and cross-platform TCR backend, TCRDS achieves full-speed operation on all platforms (including Nvidia GPU, AMD GPU, Apple M series SoC, and Huawei Ascend), outperforming traditional purpose-built systems by orders of magnitude.

* **[SeccoSQL](https://github.com/H20Zhang/SeccoSQL) (2020-2022)**: SeccoSQL (Separate communication from computation) is an experimental distributed SQL engine on Spark designed for processing complex SQL/Graph queries. It explicitly decouples Relational Algebra (RA) operators into pure communication and computation operators. SeccoSQL can reorder operators at a finer granularity than existing SQL engines, enabling a greater search space of plans and further reducing communication costs.

* **[DISC](https://github.com/H20Zhang/DISC) (2018-2020)**: DISC is a specialized graph system on Spark for computing subgraph counts of arbitrary patterns and orbits in a relational manner. Unlike existing subgraph counting approaches that operate directly on graphs, DISC decomposes subgraph counting queries into a sequence of relational queries, enabling efficient execution.

* **[Crystal](https://github.com/H20Zhang/Crystal) (2016-2017)**: Crystal is a novel method for distributed subgraph matching on very large graphs. It differs from existing subgraph matching approaches by computing compressed results of subgraph matching directly, greatly reducing computation costs.
